# BizStreamContactFormFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

This is the code for the frontend of the backend Web API for the BizStream contact form.
This is an Angular 13.2.5 app and must be run with the backend running as well, since we are using local server.

1. Open and run the [backend](https://github.com/sschaner/BizStreamContactFormBackend).
2. Open and run the frontend with ng serve --open.
3. Submit the contact form.
4. Check the backend for a text file with the form data.
5. If you have Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, you can check a created database called 'BizStreamContact' for the data as well.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
